                    </h4>
                    <p id = "p1">
                         A general survey of cultural anthropology, which is one of the main branches of general Anthropology. Employs a global and holistic perspective to examine the economic, social, political, cultural, and ideological integration of society.  The comparative, cross-cultural method distinctive to anthropology is used to explore the diverse ideas and behavior that characterize humanity and the human condition.  Presents the fundamental questions that cultural anthropologists ask, the methods they use to answer these questions, and some of the uses of anthropological knowledge.  Self-reflection and critical analysis of one's own world view assumptions and cultural belief system are fundamental objectives of the course.

                        Focuses on writing as critical inquiry through readings of cultural texts. Students learn to further question, explore, explain, analyze, develop, and critique ideas effectively at an accelerated pace; undertake writing projects that have depth and complexity; and make appropriate decisions about argument, structure, and rhetorical conventions. Students are expected to reflect critically on their processes of writing and reading, and to interrogate the ways in which texts (re)produce particular social constructions and power relations, such as those around gender, race, nationality, class, disability, and sexuality.
